# TSP-20-50-100

For solving **TSP-20-50-10** instances with 20 nodes:

```bash
cd $download-dir
cd TSP-20-50-100
bash solve-20.sh 32
```

When planning to solve TSP instanes with 50 or 100 nodes, you could correspondingly replace the last command with `bash solve-50.sh 32` or `bash solve-100.sh 32` and finally, the results could be checked in dirs `results/20`, `results/50` and `results/100`.
